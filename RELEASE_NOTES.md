# Release Notes

## v5.0.2

- **Docker Image Size Reduction** -- Migrated to Alpine-based runtime with static PJSIP linking. Image reduced from 129MB to 25MB (81% smaller). Uses a 4-stage build: PJSIP static on Alpine, bindgen on Debian, Rust build on Alpine, minimal Alpine runtime.
- **Static PJSIP Linking** -- All PJSIP libraries statically compiled into the binary; no `.so` files needed at runtime. Added `PJSUA_SYS_BINDINGS` and `PJSUA_SYS_STATIC` env vars to `pjsua-sys` build script for pre-generated bindings and static link control.
- **Call Stability Fix** -- Fixed stale `SIP_PEER_DISCONNECTED` flag causing subsequent calls to immediately hang up. The flag from a previous call's BYE was not consumed when the module was in Idle state.
- **Audio Quality Tuning** -- Disabled echo cancellation (`ec_tail_len=0`), set max quality, explicit 20ms ptime, and auto jitter buffer for improved audio on musl runtime.
- **Removed `alsa` Crate** -- Dropped unused direct ALSA dependency from `gsm-sip-bridge`.
- **Release Binary Optimization** -- Added `strip=true` and `lto="thin"` to workspace release profile.
- **Healthcheck** -- Switched from `curl` to `wget` in both Dockerfile and docker-compose.

## v5.0.1

- **Ringback Tone Fix** -- The tonegen was playing the 400 Hz ringback only once instead of looping. Now uses `PJMEDIA_TONEGEN_LOOP` so the GSM caller hears continuous ringing until the SIP extension answers.
- **Uptime Metric Fix** -- `gsm_sip_bridge_uptime_seconds` was defined but never set. Now computed on each Prometheus scrape.
- **Call Duration Histogram Fix** -- `gsm_sip_bridge_call_duration_seconds` was never observed. Now recorded at end of each call.
- **SIP Call Rate Metric Fix** -- `gsm_sip_bridge_sip_calls_total` was never incremented. Now tracks initiated/error outcomes.
- **Audio Errors Metric Fix** -- `gsm_sip_bridge_audio_errors_total` was never incremented. Now tracks sound device failures.
- **README Refresh** -- Full rewrite with Mermaid diagrams, TOML config examples, and architecture documentation.
- **Grafana Dashboard Screenshot** -- Added fresh capture from the running instance.

## v5.0.0

- **Complete Rust Rewrite** -- Replaced the C++17 implementation with a Rust workspace for memory safety, eliminating all manual memory management.
- **Three-Crate Architecture** -- `pjsua-sys` (bindgen FFI), `pjsua-safe` (safe wrappers with `// SAFETY:` comments), `gsm-sip-bridge` (zero `unsafe` binary).
- **Async Runtime** -- Tokio-based event loop with `crossbeam_channel` for the DB writer thread.
- **TOML Configuration** -- Replaced INI format with TOML; secrets support `env:VAR_NAME` syntax.
- **DID Passthrough via Headers** -- Outbound SIP INVITE carries `P-Asserted-Identity` and `X-GSM-Caller-ID` headers; leading `+` stripped from request URI.
- **PJSIP Conference Bridge Audio** -- Bidirectional audio via `pjsua_conf_connect` in `on_call_media_state` callback; ALSA device matched by card name from `/proc/asound/`.
- **SMS Text Mode** -- Switched from PDU to text mode (`AT+CMGF=1`) for simpler parsing and more reliable extraction.
- **SQLite Store Thread** -- Dedicated writer thread with `StoreCommand` enum; WAL mode for concurrent access.
- **Discord SMS Forwarding** -- Async webhook posting with DB status tracking (`pending`/`sent`/`failed`).
- **Multi-Arch Docker Image** -- Published to GHCR for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
- **CI Pipeline** -- GitHub Actions with clippy, rustfmt, cargo-deny, and full test suite.
- **Prometheus Metrics** -- All v4.x metrics carried forward with `gsm_sip_bridge_` prefix, plus new `store_writes_total`, `store_queue_depth`, and `build_info`.
- **Thread Registration** -- All PJSIP API calls preceded by `pj_thread_register()` to prevent assertion crashes from async threads.
- **Graceful Shutdown** -- SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with proper PJSIP cleanup and DB flush.

## v4.1.1

- **SIP Registration Retry** -- PJSIP now automatically retries registration after 5 minutes when the server rejects with a permanent failure (e.g. 403 Forbidden), preventing the bridge from silently going offline.
- **Database Rename** -- SMS and call database renamed from `sms.db` to `data.db` to reflect its broader scope; update `db_path` in `config.ini` if overridden.
- **sqlite-web Browser** -- Docker Compose stack now includes an optional read-only web UI (`sqlite-web`) for browsing call and SMS records at `http://localhost:8088`.

## v4.1.0

- **Call Logging** -- Every incoming GSM call is recorded in a local SQLite database with caller ID, module ID, timestamp, duration, SIP destination, and outcome (answered/missed/failed).
- **SMS Persistence** -- All received SMS messages are stored in SQLite with sender, body, timestamp, module, and Discord forwarding status, surviving restarts and Discord outages.
- **sqlite-web UI** -- Docker Compose stack now includes a read-only web interface for browsing call and SMS records at `http://localhost:8088`.

## v4.0.0

- **SMS-to-Discord Forwarding** -- Captures incoming SMS from all modules, persists to a local SQLite database, and posts rich embed notifications to a configurable Discord webhook.
- **SMS Monitoring** -- Independent SMS polling on all modules via AT commands (`AT+CMGL`), with automatic SIM cleanup after read.
- **Configurable via `[sms]` section** -- Enable/disable SMS, set Discord webhook URL, and configure database path in `config.ini`.

## v3.0.1

- **Build Performance** -- PJSIP Docker build layer is now cached across branches and tags, significantly reducing CI build times.
- **CMake FetchContent** -- Replaced vendored mINI header with CMake FetchContent for cleaner dependency management.
- **License** -- Added GNU GPL v3 license.

## v3.0.0

- **Prometheus Metrics** -- Exposes call counts, SIP registration state, module health, audio errors, and call duration histograms on a `/metrics` endpoint (default port 9091).
- **Grafana Dashboard** -- Ships a pre-provisioned dashboard with panels for system overview, call rates, active calls, duration percentiles, module health, and error rates.
- **Docker Compose Monitoring Stack** -- One-command deployment of the bridge with Prometheus and Grafana in host network mode.

## v2.0.0

- **Multi-Card Support** -- Detects all connected EC20 modules at startup, assigns stable hardware IDs derived from USB serial numbers, and handles concurrent calls across modules independently.
- **Automatic Module Recovery** -- Failed modules (SIM issues, serial errors) are retried every 30 seconds and rejoin the active pool when functional.
- **Single-Card Override** -- Explicit `--serial` and `--audio` flags bypass auto-detection for single-module setups.

## v1.1.0

- **DID Passthrough** -- `sip_destination` is now optional. When empty, the GSM caller's number is used as the SIP DID, letting the PBX inbound route decide the destination extension.
- **SIP Media Renegotiation Fix** -- Audio bridge now reconnects correctly after SIP re-INVITE (media hold/resume scenarios).
- **SIP TCP Transport Fix** -- Fixed connection type when using TCP transport.

## v1.0.0

- **GSM-to-SIP Call Bridging** -- Auto-answers incoming GSM calls on a Quectel EC20 module and bridges audio bidirectionally to a SIP extension via a PBX.
- **SIP Audio Echo** -- Standalone SIP echo server for testing (echoes audio back to caller).
- **GSM Audio Echo** -- Standalone GSM echo tool for hardware validation (echoes modem audio back to caller).
- **Caller ID Forwarding** -- GSM caller's number is forwarded to SIP via P-Asserted-Identity header for DID routing.
- **Lock-Free Audio Pipeline** -- SPSC ring buffers connect ALSA capture/playback to the PJSIP conference bridge with minimal latency.
- **USB Auto-Discovery** -- Detects EC20 modules by scanning the USB bus for vendor/product ID `2c7c:0125`.
- **Docker + CI** -- Multi-platform Docker image (amd64/arm64) with GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
